# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

This is an impact plan designed for an introduction to computing course. The target grade level is 9th grade. 
While many students arrive at high school able to use a smartphone, they lack many important skills related to success in academics and the workplace. 
The course would work with students on formatting word processing documents, spreadsheets, and slides. 
The course would also cover use of email as well as more specialized applications. 
As a supplement to the core curriculum, the class will also address the impact the computer has had on society. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

Students will be able to
- Classify breakthroughs in computing into positive, negative, and mixed categories. 
- Demonstrate impacts of computers on societal development. 
- Implement a plan to address a current social issue. 
- Compare and contrast similar technologies and their impacts on society. 

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

**Case Studies**

This will be the primary activity used in the course. The teacher will present an article, video, or other form of media that demonstrates social issues related to computing. Students will be expected to classify advancements by societal impact. Students will present informed opinions about the material. 

Issues to be addressed are: 
1. Diversity and inclusion in the field. 
2. Positive and negative impacts in various industries. 
3. The role of social media and targeted advertising in modern society.
4. How computing can be used to address economic inequality and developing econommies.  

Some example atricles: 

[Diversity in STEM](https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/news/diversity-stem-what-it-why-does-it-matter-and-how-do-we-increase-it#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20NSF%2C%20the,all%20children%20born%20are%20female.)

[Computer use in Agriculture of Developing Economies](https://justagriculture.in/files/newsletter/2022/january/5.%20Use%20of%20Computer%20in%20Agriculture.pdf)

[Social media impact on mental health](https://www.healthline.com/health/social-media-and-mental-health)

**Past, Present, and Future** 

This will be the culminating project for the impacts portion of the course. The project will be given and assessed in three parts. 
Students will be required to look at the development of computing through the framework of societal impact. 
1. Past - Students will do independent research into past events that were heavily influenced by developments in computer technolgies. 
- Students will identify an issue from the past that was addressed with a computer based solution. 
- Students will demonstrate how computers were used in addressing that issue. 
2. Present - Students will identify a current issue and create a computer based solution to help address the problem. 
- Students will identify an issue that is facing society in the current day. 
- Students will create an action plan to use computers to address the issue. 
3. Future - Students will predict a future problem and show how computers could be used to prevent the issue. 
- Students will identify an issue that is likely to be a problem in the future. 
- Students will analyze how computers would be effective in dealing with the issue or preventing it entirely. 
4. Response - students will reflect on a fellow student's contribution 
- Students will compare and contrast the role of the computer in society between theirs and a fellow classmates contribution. 

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

**Case Studies** 

Case studies will be addressed in a variety of forms. 
- Written responses - particularly early in the course, direct responses will be used. 
- Class discussions - As students get more familiar with the concepts, classroom discussions will be enployed that in particular use frameworks such as fishbowl and jigsaw. 

**Past, Present, and Future**
Students will have an option in this portion of the course regarding how they wish to demonstrate their learning. 
- Verbal - Students may present their findings in a short verbal report with accompanying visual aid. 
- Written - Students may present their findings in a short magazine-style article. 
- Recorded - Students may present their findings in a short podcast. 


### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

The primary outcome is students who are aware of social issues surrounding computing. 
In particular students should understand the current state and demographics of the tech industry. 
Additionally, students will be able to present action plans to address the diversity issue in STEM. 
Students will be able to describe societal issues both caused and solved by computers. 
Students will be able to analyze current issues in the context of computing's role in causing or solving them. 
These outcomes will help foster a culture of citizenship and inclusivity around the subject of computing and STEM in general.
